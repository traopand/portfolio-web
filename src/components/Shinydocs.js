      <div className="paragraph">
        From September to December of 2021, I completed an internship at
        Shinydocs as a Front-end Software Developer. I primarily worked on
        building, testing, and documenting an accessible UI Library that was
        used across all company platforms.
      </div>
      <div className="subheading">The UI Library</div>
      <div className="paragraph">
        Prior to working with Shinydocs, I had experience working with external
        libraries such as React Bootstrap or Material UI, when developing
        platforms. However, what I didn‚Äôt realize was the amount of effort that
        goes into the development of such libraries that allow developers to
        seamlessly build. I developed fully accessible components including a
        treeview, dropzone, tabs, and more from scratch using React and
        Typescript.

      <div className="subheading">The Treeview</div>
      <div className="paragraph">
        {" "}
        Among all of the components I worked on, I'm most proud of the treeview
        as it not only challenged my technological abilities but gave me the
        opportunity to apply theoretical concepts such as DFS to a real-life use
        case. It's a UI component that visually displays nested arrays in an
        organized and intuitive manner with accessible integration for an easy
        user experience.
