        order items from their own or restaurant-provided devices using the

      <div className="paragraph">
        My first major project was coding the redesign of the Quicktab website
        using React JS alongside another software developer. As seen in the
        images below, I coded the header, For Restaurants, For Guests, About
        Quicktab, and FAQ pages. In addition, I implemented a blog feature to
        allow the company to post updates and new releases. View the website

      <div className="subheading">Restaurant Web App Redesign </div>
      <div className="paragraph">
        I was also part of the Restaurant Web App development team. In this
        team, I helped code the restaurant side of their platform allowing
        servers to manage orders. I coded the incoming orders section that
        allowed servers to either cancel or send items to the kitchen as well as
        the order history component. In addition, I redesigned a past orders
        section that allowed servers to view their complete order history along
        with session details including the bill, items ordered, and payment
        status. I primarily used javascript and firebase for data collection and
        manipulation in the back-end, and react as a framework for the
        front-end.

      <div className="subheading">QR Code Internal Tool </div>
      <div className="paragraph">
        Finally, I coded a feature for the Quicktab team to allow them to view
        all of the tables across restaurants and obtain QR Codes that would
        allow users to check in to these tables. I used Firebase and React JS to
        collect the data and then formatted the QR Codes and implemented a
        download function so that the QR Codes could be easily saved and printed
        to be distributed at their restaurants.
