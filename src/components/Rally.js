        about what they believe in and bring together communities with a common
        goal in mind. We also wanted to inform protestors about key information
        as well as incorporate customization so that users are well-prepared for
        any upcoming protests.

      <div className="subheading">How we built it</div>
      <div className="paragraph">
        The app was built using React Native, JavaScript, Node.js and ReactJS.
        We used expo as an emulator and Figma to draft our designs. To divide
        the work, we decided to give each member an equal share of the workload,
        and partition the work so every member could work concurrently. This
        way, nobody was forced to slow down and wait for others. Since one of
        our group members was more comfortable with UI and graphic design, we
        thought it was the most efficient use of his talent to allocate most of
        the Figma designs to him, while the other 3 members worked on the code.
        This way we made the best use of all of our talents, to work as
        efficiently and as contentedly as possible.

        experience working with the mentioned languages,
        <span style={{ color: "#ED7B82", fontWeight: "bold" }}>
          debugging{" "}
        </span>{" "}
        was challenging as we were unfamiliar with common errors and how to
        address them. Additionally, we had team-members working on both{" "}

          Android and iOS{" "}
        </span>{" "}
        devices which made it difficult to combine the code given styling
        differences between the different devices.

        Prior to this weekend, three of our members had never been exposed to
        React Native and two of our members were first time hackers! Given our
        limited experience, we are extremely proud of what we were able to
        accomplish in such short time.

            Incorporate direct communication with others through our app, which

            private and secure messaging

          <li>
            Imorove accuracy of protest search through the addition of advanced
            search options (e.g. filtering by location)
          </li>
        </ul>
        Overall we hope to maintain a positive and user-friendly environment for
        both individuals and organizers to come together and make a change in
        their local or greater community.
